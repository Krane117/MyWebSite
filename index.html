      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a creative person with a passion for computer engineering. 
        I have experience both in interacting with people of different nationalities and cultures and in working independently with freelancers, 
        acquiring new knowledge. I am able to work in a team, actively seek opportunities to implement innovative solutions and improve processes. 
        I have a flexible approach to problem solving, I easily adapt to new conditions and I manage my time effectively. 
        My goal is to continue to develop as a professional, make a valuable contribution to successful projects 
        and contribute to the creation of high-quality software. My interests are the gym, cars and travel.
